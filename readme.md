# My Persona/Semi-professional Webpage

- **Why?** &mdash; since the <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takanori/index.html" target="_blank">current layout</a> of my personal webpage looks boring.
- Still in rough development stage...but debating on the following candidates of *html-skeleton*:
    - <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takanori/index-new.html" target="_blank">Layout Candidate 1</a>  
    - <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takanori/index-new-ver2.html" target="_blank">Layout Candidate 2</a>  
- Trying to learn bunch of new stuffs (javascript jquery d3 php...)
while balancing  with research and TA duties....tough times but refreshingly fun!

## Desiderata
- Want to keep things simple, as it's very easy to fall in the "more is less" trap in these kinds of stuffs...
- That said, want some sharp design/look with a *modern* feel (very loose description, but I'll work on this as things shapes up).
- I plan on posting snippets of my research notebook to provide the viewers what kind of "thinker" I am, and demonstrate how I tackle open ended problems in a mathematically sound manner.
- I also plan to add graphical/visual explanation about my research (like in a conference poster style), and explain how the results from my research can be replicated from the Matlab codes hosted on Github.
